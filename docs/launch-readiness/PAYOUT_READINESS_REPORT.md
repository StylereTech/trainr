# Payout Readiness Report

2026-10-08 athlete-profile update: owned create/edit/delete flows now validate calendar dates and active sports, serialize mutations, reject stale edits and preserve booked history. A durable creation request/tombstone prevents same-key duplicate saves or resurrection. Baseline `60c68fbf98c6e6472b0dbd2966dabdd5afd8a1ca`; **735 unit and 186 real local SQL tests passed**. [Exact routes, accounts, initial deadlock/test-selector failures, browser retests, migration requirements and publication evidence](ATHLETE_PROFILE_REPORT.md). New migration tested only on the disposable database. Child-data retention, cross-navigation retry recovery and all staging/live money-flow gates remain open. Production HOLD.

2026-10-08 cancellation/Checkout update: cancellation now attempts provider-session expiry after committing the booking; an in-flight creation keeps its durable identity and withholds the URL. Recovery uses the original bounded idempotency key, and paid/ambiguous outcomes remain under review. Admins can retry closure for cancelled bookings. Baseline `5a0700b76f074c12b9e74347cab24f47ae4b5b0e`; [exact tests, failures, retests and publication proof](CANCELLATION_CHECKOUT_REPORT.md). Stripe is simulated locally. Refund execution, automatic recovery scheduling and full live money-flow signoff remain open. Production HOLD.

2026-10-08 account/email audit: registration and trainer notices are now atomic; verification/recovery call Resend with bounded requests, explicit failure states and retryable persisted tokens. Verification is an explicit one-time POST, with role-aware signup and signed-in recovery tested locally. Baseline `8652e4c50674ec461eecfe6e7e3e1550651529b6`; **678 unit and 152 real local SQL tests passed**. [Exact steps, browser/build evidence, initial failures and remaining gates](ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REGISTRATION_REPORT.md). External email delivery, token-storage hardening, child-profile completeness and all live money-flow/rollout gates remain open. Production readiness HOLD.

2026-10-08 deployment audit: `trainr.cc` remains on older source; the audit preview is not configured for isolated Stripe tests. No payout was created, received or verified. Production checker improvements provide only bounded read-only authentication evidence, never payout signoff. [Exact observations and release gates](DEPLOYMENT_CONFIGURATION_REPORT.md). HOLD.

2026-10-08 Connect identity update: both setup endpoints now preserve existing Stripe account IDs and share a durable, bounded-idempotency creation attempt. Ambiguous/expired creation requires reconciliation, not replacement; provider failures no longer expose cached readiness as current truth. Dashboard status is schema-validated and retryable; creation email is redacted on success or closure. Baseline `0eab36674bbbfaf75d84d0671f0ca30869771a16` plus this commit. **644 unit tests and 134 real local PostgreSQL tests passed**; exact routes, accounts, initial failures, migration/ops requirements and final browser/build/publication evidence are in the [Connect identity report](CONNECT_ACCOUNT_IDENTITY_REPORT.md). Stripe is simulated. No production migration/promotion or real money movement; full readiness and money-flow signoff remain HOLD.

2026-10-08 dashboard data update: parent/trainer booking counts and history are now role-scoped and paginated from a consistent SQL snapshot. Failed/malformed reads show explicit errors, trainer actions reload persisted state, and booked allocations are no longer presented as total earnings. Stripe balances remain provider-sourced with unknown/error states. Baseline `0dfd7a19e9155facc7be7a95e41cb741fb5ba0be` plus this commit; **634 unit tests and 114 real local SQL tests passed**. Exact routes, accounts, steps, initial failures, browser retest and publication evidence are in the [dashboard integrity report](DASHBOARD_DATA_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md). External Stripe observations in tests are simulated. No real charge/refund/transfer/payout, production migration or production promotion occurred; full production and money-flow signoff remain HOLD.

2026-10-08 refund reconciliation update: per-refund provider observations now separate successful, pending and failed/cancelled outcomes; legacy totals require verification. Reconciliation is transactional with notices/audit, handles signed lifecycle events and exposes an admin read-only Stripe refresh. Baseline `0cfb4f550b88271d273bb4e744e44ca82fedfbf6` plus this commit. **613 unit tests, 106 real local SQL tests, production build and six focused desktop/mobile refund browser checks passed**. Exact accounts, steps, routes, expectations, actual results, initial disk failure, retest and final broader-browser/publication evidence are in the [refund audit](REFUND_RECONCILIATION_REPORT.md). Stripe reads are simulated locally; production smoke was anonymous and on older code. No real refund/transfer/payout or production migration occurred. Full production/money-flow signoff remains HOLD; this is not refund execution or Connect/payout verification.

> 2026-10-06 audit supersedes the readiness conclusions below. See [current checkpoint](AUDIT_CHECKPOINT_2026-10-06.md) for baseline SHA, environment, exact checks, fixes, open defects, and retest status. This document's April results are historical and do not establish current production readiness. Money movement is NOT signed off; fixable repository blockers remain.

- Date/time: 2026-04-24 00:55 UTC / 2026-04-23 17:55 America/Los_Angeles
- Environment tested: live production `https://trainr.cc`, local code audit
- Commit SHA tested: final pushed commit `71edba76ac7070856ab5a1cffed0b40c9ea8a652`
- Accounts used: trainer `marcus.johnson@email.com`, admin `admin@trainr.app`

## Routes And Endpoints Tested
- `/trainer/dashboard`
- `/api/trainer/wallet`
- `/api/trainer/wallet/withdraw`
- `/api/admin/payouts`
- `/api/payments/webhook`

## Steps
1. Logged in as trainer and loaded dashboard/wallet checks.
2. Logged in as admin and called `/api/admin/payouts`.
3. Audited wallet credit logic in Stripe webhook.
4. Audited withdrawal request logic and admin payout queue.

## Expected Result
Successful payment credits trainer wallet, trainer can request withdrawal, admin can see/process payout queue through v1 manual ops.

## Actual Result
- Trainer wallet API is present and role-protected.
- Withdrawal API atomically moves available balance to pending balance and creates a withdrawal request.
- Admin payout queue returned `200` with empty `withdrawals: []`.
- No live payout could be completed because the demo trainer connected account is not fully onboarded and no available withdrawal balance was present.

## Pass/Fail
Partial pass. Ledger and manual request path exist; live payout completion is blocked by Stripe account/balance state.

## Blocker Status
External/account-state blocker: complete Stripe Connect onboarding and generate a successful paid booking before testing payout execution.

## Fix Status
No payout code change required in this pass. Documented v1 manual path in `V1_MANUAL_OPS_RUNBOOK.md`.

## Retest Proof
- Live admin suite: 15/15 passed, including payouts page/API.
- Live role boundary suite: trainer wallet withdrawal cross-role test passed.
